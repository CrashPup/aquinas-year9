# Welcome to the year 9 Project Repository

This repository is the central hub for your classes collaborative project. Whether you're a programmer, designer, planner, or documentor, this README will help you understand how to use Markdown to create organized and informative content in this repository.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text with simple, easy-to-read syntax. It's widely used on platforms like GitHub for creating documentation, README files, and more.

## How to Use Markdown

Using Markdown is straightforward. Here are some common formatting options you'll need:

### Headers

To create headers, use the `#` symbol followed by a space. The more `#` symbols you use, the smaller the header.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

### Lists

For unordered lists, use asterisks `*`, plus `+`, or hyphens `-`. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by periods.

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem A
  - Subitem B
1. First item
2. Second item
```

### Emphasis

Use asterisks `*` or underscores `_` to make text italic, and use double asterisks `**` or double underscores `__` to make text bold.

```
*Italic Text*
**Bold Text**
```

### Links

To create links, enclose the linked text in square brackets `[]` and follow it with the URL in parentheses `()`.

```
[Visit our GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo)
```

### Images

To add images, use an exclamation mark `!`, followed by alt text in square brackets `[]`, and the image URL in parentheses `()`.

```
![Alt Text](image-url-here)
```

### Code Blocks

Use backticks ``` to create inline code or triple backticks to create code blocks.

```
Inline code: `console.log("Hello, Markdown!");`
```

```
```
Code Block
console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
```
```


## Examples

Check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more examples of formatting options and their syntax.

Remember, clear and organized documentation makes collaboration easier, so take advantage of Markdown's simplicity to create informative content for our game development project.

Happy coding and designing!
